# wad2map - Maps for WADs

`wad2map` is a Rust program written to create maps from Doom WAD files.


## Installation

To install, use the following set of instructions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sleibrock/wad2map && cd wad2map
cargo install
```

You need to use Rust's Cargo tool, so make sure you install Rust with Rustup.

## Instructions

`wad2map` accepts a path to a WAD file and will render all maps in the WAD into a new folder the same name as the WAD. `wad2map` also accepts multiple WADs at once for batch rendering. 

More instructions: **soon**.
